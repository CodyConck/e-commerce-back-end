  Clone the repo and install NPM. Make sure to check your dependencies in the package.json file for dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize. 
  
  ## Usage 
  In the command line, use the command "npm run seed" to drop and create tables, sync the database, and seed the database. Once seeded, use the command "npm start" to start the server. Navigate to Insomnia Core where you can test CRUD methods at http://localhost:3001/ using the database you just created and seeded.
